The files LidDrivenCavity, LidDrivenCavitySolver and SolverCG were provided by the Aeronautics Department at Imperial College London as part of the High performance computing (HPC) coursework.
The brief was to parallelize the solver to increase the computational efficiency, create a makefiile, several unittests to be used throughout and maintain a Repository (repostiory.log). The code presented in this repository is my submission for the coursework, with parallelization using MPI.
Files array_data and vnew_out are for use in the Test.cpp file, as saved outputs from the code prior to parallelization.
